Heap Sort
Description and complexity analysis 

- Why we chose heap sort
We chose heap sort as our assignment1 sort because it has 
good time complexity such as quick and merge.

- time complexity analysis 
Since the total height of the heap tree is almost log2n, 
the time to rearrange the heap is consumed log2n 
when inserting or deleting one element into the heap.
Since the number of elements is n, it takes time for 
O(nlog2n) as a whole.

Time complexity O(n Log n)

- Description of heap sort
  Heap can divide into two part max heap and min heap.
  The maximum heap is that each node has a property where 
the value of the corresponding node is greater than the 
value of the child node, so the root node has the maximum value.
  On the contrary, the minimum heap has a smaller value than the 
child node, so the root node has a minimum value.
  The heap is a binary tree, and all layers except the bottom layer 
must be completely filled. Nodes on the bottom layer have the 
property of being filled sequentially from the left.
